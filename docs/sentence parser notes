 A common NMEA sentence format is listed below:

It is necessary to specify:

NMEA defines two types of sentences: proprietary and non-proprietary. 

Non-proprietary sentences have a one of standard two-letter talker ID (e.g., GP for GPS unit, GL for glonass unit, etc.), and one of standard three-letter sentence ID (e.g., GLL for geographic location GPS data, DBK - depth below keel, and so on). All of these talker IDs and sentence IDs can be found in the official paper. 

Proprietary sentences have a 'P' letter instead of the standard talker ID, followed by a three-letter standard manufacturer code (GRM for Garmin, MTK for MTK, etc.), and further follows any string - name of proprietary command (depends on the specific manufacturer). 

Maximum length for sentences â€“ 82 characters.
