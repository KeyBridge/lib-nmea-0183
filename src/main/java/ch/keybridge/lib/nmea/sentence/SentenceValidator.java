	 * Tells if the specified String matches the NMEA 0183 sentence format.</p>
	 * <p>
	 * String is considered as a sentence if it meets the following criteria:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>First character is '$' or '!'
	 * <li>Begin char is followed by upper-case sentence ID (3 to 10 chars)
	 * <li>Sentence ID is followed by a comma and an arbitrary number of
	 *     printable ASCII characters (payload data)
	 * <li>Data is followed by '*' and a two-char hex checksum (may be omitted)
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Notice that format matching is not strict; although NMEA 0183 defines a
	 * maximum length of 80 chars, the sentence length is not checked. This is
	 * due to fact that it seems quite common that devices violate this rule,
	 * some perhaps deliberately, some by mistake. Thus, assuming the formatting
	 * is otherwise valid, it is not feasible to strictly validate length and
	 * discard sentences that just exceed the 80 chars limit.
	 * </p>

	 * @param nmea String to inspect
	 * @return true if recognized as sentence, otherwise false.
